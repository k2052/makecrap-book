# Make Crap

I want to make something. I want to make something amazing. Something great! Something magnificent!
Something consistently mind-blowing, wonderful and delightful. I want to make things that make people feel joy, that make people feel; "this is the way it should have always been!". Something that makes them ask: "Why didn't I think of that?". I want to make something perfect.

I know that is silly. But that is what we should strive for right? That is how great things are made right? A sense of perfection is the compass that points towards greatness right? That is how Apple was made right?

Build what you want to use. Stick to your principles. Simplify until you find the heart of your product. Fail often, fail fast, and fail hard. Learn from those failures. Then fail again. And above all just work your ass off. If you do this, they say, then one day you'll make something perfect.

But I have never made something perfect. I have made crap.
