In the fall of 1959 in a forest, in East Pakistan, something wonderful and mostly unexpected was happening. All the bamboo was dying. 

Bamboo has perhaps the most poetic life cycle of any plant. An entire bamboo forest is born from a single bamboo. It grows at phenomenal speeds, some species grow as much as 29in [?] in 24 hours. And every 50 to 70 years it dies, taking the entire forest with it.

This particular forest was very important to the Karnaphuli pulp and paper mill. Bamboo was all the mill processed and the forest would take with it 85% of its raw material. 

To add to already mounting oversights, the mill had missed a few crucial facts'

1. This particular species of bamboo took years to regrow to adequate heights.
2. Flowered bamboo has a tendency to disintegrate, making it for all practical purposes, useless. 

The bamboo was life blood of the mill and the mill in turn, made the entire local economy tick. Without the bamboo there would be no mill. Without the mill there would be nothing. 

In only its seventh year of operation, the mill was faced with the very real prospect of having nothing to mill. If they didn't act fast, the mill, like the bamboo, would be dead.

If you had asked the managers of the Karnaphuli pulp and paper mill how they felt at that time, they would have chosen
far different adjectives than "wonderful" to describe their situation. Words like "crap!" probably came most easily to their minds.

Over the next few years the managers of the Karnaphuli pulp and paper mill would come up with a variety of solutions to keep the mill going. First, they diversified into other woods. 

No longer dependent on bamboo the mill gradually made an economic comeback.

It's not that the mill managers were particularly creative or particularly adept at business. It was that they were forced to be creative.
