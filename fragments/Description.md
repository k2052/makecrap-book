I'm going to making something awesome.

I know what font to use. I'm going to use Nexa. Nexa is this fantastic slab serif I saw recommended on twitter yesterday. I just saw this great palette on colours lovers so I even know what colors to use. 

I don't really have to bother starting on it until tomorrow. I mean, it's going to practically create itself from here.Making this is going to be so easy. It is going to be perfect. 

What we make is never perfect. It never lives up to our expectations. It never matches our vision. It sucks. 

What we make sucks because our skills aren't good enough. Our skills aren't good enough because we haven't made enough.
It's a vicious catch-22 that can take a maker years (or even decades) to break free from. 

This book is about learning to make. About breaking free and just making, crap.

## This book is being written in one month

As part of my project [OneAppOneBookOneMonth.com](http://OneAppOneBookOneMonth.com).
Updates are going to come fast and messy. That said, I will only send an email out to readers once, when 
it is complete. If you'd like to keep a closer eye on the progress you can follow the [blog](http://notes.OneAppOneBookOneMonth.com) or the [github repo](http://github.com/k2052/makecrap)

## This book is open source

And licensed under the MIT License. This is not because I want you to give me nothing, I just want you to have freedom.
It is my hope that by making my work open source that it becomes more valuable to you.

Feel free to take my book and use it in whatever way you like, in whatever way furthers your life the most. I only ask
that in return, you contribute back to me what I contributed to you.
