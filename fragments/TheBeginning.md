And the icon font needs hinting at 32px or it will look blurry when we add a bigger icon bar in the future. The texture on the background needs a bit more contrast between the right upper swirl and the little 1px line one the right side. Now that I think about it that 1px line should probably be 2px on retina. The gray used for the links needs to be a different shade. I better hint the logo a bit more, that edge is driving me insane!

I should just release this. But this is crap. I cant make crap.

They say you should just "execute" and "you can always make it better later". But how can I do that when I know it's crap? I can see so many things wrong with it. If I made crap then they wouldn't notice me. If it's going to be successful then it's going to need to be amazing. Worse than not getting noticed, not being successful, I might be criticized. I can only take critique if it tells me how awesome it is. 

I cant finish crap.

I want to make stuff. Great stuff! Magnificent things! I want to build consistently mind-blowing, wonderful and delightful products. I want to design stuff that makes people feel joy. Tools that make people think; "this is the way it should have always been!". I want to make apps that makes users ask: "Why didn't I think of that?". 

I don't want to make crap. I want to make something perfect. But all I seem to make is crap. 

I'm not going to even finish this. It is crap. I'll start over and do it right then it will be perfect.

If we stick to our principles. If we keep it simple. If we grow, adept, and pivot. If we scratch our own itch. If we delight. If we follow the latest trends. If we use flat UI kits and bootstrap it. If we make it with LISP like Paul Graham. If we use Clojure and Clojurescript. If we functionally react with the latest programming event driven frameworks.

Then it will be perfect. 

I just need to make it the right way. I need to use the right tools. I need to use the right fonts. I need to use the right techniques. The right marketing speak. The right buzzwords.

Then I wont make crap.

Nothing hurts more than seeing your vision turn to crap. Making is the act of taking what you want to see and attempting to manifest it in reality. The problem is, our imaginations are very poor judges of reality. What we want
to create is not what we will create, or even what we could create.

Ira Glass calls this the taste gap:

> But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints

The question is, how do we close that gap? The answer is obvious, *Make Crap*. Make a ton of crap. 
Just keep making, keep failing, until that gap starts to close. 

The problem is -- and I really wish someone had told me this... is that the gap never closes. Every-time you make something, your skills get that much better and your imagination -- your vision, it stretches that much further. 

Your skills increase. Your taste gets better. The gap never closes.

What is a creative to do? 

I suppose I could develop a serious case of Imposter Syndrome. If I tell them what is wrong with my work before they do, then they'll see I'm actually perfect. I'll point out all the flaws. "Yeah, I know the kerning is a little off. Sometimes you just have to finish because the client will kill you otherwise. haha"

I suppose I could create in secret, under another identity so they don't who makes this crap. If it turns out to be amazing I can immerse myself in the feedback. I'll eat up the praise and ignore the hate.

I could become obsessive over producing something perfect. I could bury myself in years of hard work until it is perfect. One day, I'll emerge from cave, descend from the mountains, journey down into the proverbial dribbble village, release the greatest thing they have ever seen. But they might not care. I could spend a lifetime building something for no one.

Or I could just make crap. 

I don't know how to make crap but I'm going to learn how to make crap. 

Over the next thirty days I'm going to forcibly teach myself the skills needed to finish things.

I'm going to prototype an app. The app will be a design app that merges css/html capabilities with the power of a graphics editor. Sort of Webkit meets Photoshop. More details will come over the next 48 hours. Thirty days from now on [?] I will release it.

I'm going to document the entire process in blog posts and notes. At the thirty day mark when I release the app I will simultaneously release a book called "Make Crap".

Until the moon falls and the remnants of humanity divide into factions of cannibals and primitive tribes,
