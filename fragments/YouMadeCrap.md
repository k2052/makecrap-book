You made crap. You didn't set out to make crap. It just happened. You had visions and dreams and desires for greatness.
If only your visions translated better to reality.

You suck.

I didn't start out this way. I wasn't always a crap machine. In my mind I made great things. 

I spent days browsing Dribbble and I thought of great icons. I spent my nights on Behance dreaming up posters. I painted on Deviantart. I crafted covers for mixes on DesignersMX. It all looked so easy. I was going to the make amazing things like this. Inspiration was a catalyst for imagining and my imagination was becoming a genius.

When I took my visions and tried to manifest them on a Photoshop canvas it was crap. It hadn't looked anything like this. What the fuck had happened? What had I had done? 

I'm never going to be any good at this. I should just start over and become a bike messenger in some town. Some town where downtown is free of guys in fedoras lugging MacBooks talking about how buzzword is gonna change the world.

Maybe it isn't so bad. I think I can fix it. I can see the end now. It looks better already and I haven't even changed a thing. Imagine when I actually execute on my imagination, it's gonna be amazing. I'm gonna change the world.

You thought a font would change everything. Helvetica? No one uses Helvitca anymore. Helvetica Neue Light? No, that is stale. Proxima Nova? Don't follow trends man. Helvetica? FF Meta Slab? You just said that because you watched Helvetica and developed a man-crush on some German named Spiekerman. Futura? Dude, stop watching films and get back to work. Ubuntu Sans? Stop reading HN articles on Ubuntu mobile.

You thought inspiration would change everything. You devoured all the latest trends on Dribbble, behance and in those magazines. A long shadow brought you hollow praise. A flat UI got you only half the way. You still made crap.

You thought an epiphany would change everything. Just a little more Seth Godin. Maybe a short story. Maybe a novel. You'd read Re-work. Great artists steal. Ira Glass is so wise. Maybe another podcast. 

You thought a tool would change everything. Sketch.app is the latest crave. But Fireworks is just like it right? Designers should code. I'll use CSS for everything. What about SVG? Everything will be scalable, it'll be magical.

You thought a change in workflow would change everything. I'll wake up at 7 and get everything. I'll consume coffee at eight. That ground stuff 

I should keep it simple. I should choose colors first. I should seek sources of inspiration outside my medium. I should plunge in and just execute. 

This is hard.
