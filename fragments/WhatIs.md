I'm going to making something awesome.

I know what font to use. I'm going to use Nexa. Nexa is this fantastic slab serif I saw recommended on twitter yesterday. I just saw this great palette on colours lovers so I even know what colors to use. 

I don't really have to bother starting on it until tomorrow. I mean, it's going to practically create itself from here.Making this is going to be so easy. It is going to be perfect. 

What we make is never perfect. It never lives up to our expectations. It never matches our vision. It sucks. 

What we make sucks because our skills aren't good enough. Our skills aren't good enough because we haven't made enough.
It's a vicious catch-22 that can take a maker years (or even decades) to break free from. 

This book is about learning to make. About breaking free and just making, crap.
