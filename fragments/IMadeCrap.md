And the icon font needs hinting at 32px or it will look blurry when we add a bigger icon bar in the future. The texture
on the background needs a bit more contrast between the right upper swirl and the little 1px line on the right side.
Now that I think about it, that 1px line should probably be 2px on retina. The gray used for the links needs to be a
different shade. 

And I better hint the logo a bit more, that edge is driving me insane!

I should just release this. But this is crap. I cant make crap.

They say you "can always make it better later". You should just release it now and then you can improve it later. Just iterate you idiot!

But how can I release crap? How can I share something that has so many flaws? How can I show something that makes me ashamed to look at it?

If I made crap then they wouldn't notice me. If it's going to be successful then it's going to need to be amazing. 

If it's crap I might be criticized. They'll tell me I'm crap. I'll feel like crap. I can only take critique if it tells me how awesome it is. 

I want to make stuff. Great stuff! Magnificent things! I want to build consistently mind-blowing, wonderful and delightful products. I want to design stuff that makes people feel joy. Tools that make people think; "this is the way it should have always been!". I want to make apps that makes users ask: "Why didn't I think of that?". 

I don't want to make crap. I want to make something perfect. All I make is crap. 

I'm not going to even finish this. It is crap. I'll start over and do it right. 

Then it will be perfect.

If we stick to our principles. If we keep it simple. If we grow, adapt and pivot. If we scratch our own itch. If we delight. If we follow the latest trends. If we use flat UI kits and bootstrap it. If we make it with LISP like Paul Graham. If we use Clojure and Clojurescript. If we functionally react with the latest programming event driven frameworks.

Then it will be perfect. 

I just need to make it the right way. I need to use the right tools. I need to use the right fonts. I need to use the right techniques. The right marketing speak. The right buzzwords.

Then I wont make crap.
